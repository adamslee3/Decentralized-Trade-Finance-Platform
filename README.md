# Decentralized Trade Finance Platform

## Overview
This project implements a blockchain-based solution for international trade finance. The system removes intermediaries, reduces costs, and accelerates cross-border transactions while maintaining security and regulatory compliance throughout the trade lifecycle.

## Core Components

### Exporter Verification Contract
Validates seller credentials through a reputation system that records transaction history, performance metrics, and compliance status. Provides trading partners with cryptographically secured proof of exporter legitimacy and trade capacity.

### Letter of Credit Contract
Manages conditional payment guarantees between importers, exporters, and their respective financial institutions. Digitizes the traditional letter of credit process through smart contracts that automatically enforce terms and monitor compliance with trade agreements.

### Shipping Documentation Contract
Tracks essential trade documentation including bills of lading, certificates of origin, inspection certificates, and customs declarations. Creates immutable records of shipping events with timestamps and verification from authorized parties in the supply chain.

### Payment Release Contract
Automates the secure transfer of funds when all contractual conditions are met, reducing payment delays and disputes. Implements escrow mechanisms that protect all parties until documentary evidence confirms successful fulfillment of trade obligations.
